# Virtual-Tourist-Udacity-FinalProject
This App downloads and stores images from Flickr. 
The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. 
Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.
